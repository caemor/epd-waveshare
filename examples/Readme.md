# Examples:

### embedded_linux_epd4in2

Basic example of using a Raspberry Pi with the 4in2 Waveshare E-Ink Display.

It showcases most of what can be done with the crate.

### embedded_linux_epd1in54

This example doesn't use the graphics feature of the crate and shows the fast update rate of the 1in54 EPD.
